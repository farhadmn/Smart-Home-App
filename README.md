Context is the key to creating the dynamic and truly personalized mobile apps. Traditionally, context-aware app development and management has been time consuming, technically complex and expensive, working against the need for a fast time-to-market and flexible interface that can be tweaked in real-time to meet customer needs. SenSoMod/SenSoMod-Modeler help developers to develop fast and easy a context-aware apps.One of the advantages of using SenSoMod/SenSoMod-Modeler for context-aware apps development is that you can export the model as Java Source Code and import it in IDE e.g. Android Studio.
